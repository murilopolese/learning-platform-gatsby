# Welcome to Strawbees Learning

This site is a virtual oasis for innovative teachers who embrace hands-on learning with [Strawbees](/what-is-strawbees). Please come in and explore our digital home for [Lesson Plans](/lesson-plans), [Activities](/activities), [Explorations](/explorations) and support materials designed to help you and your students thrive!

This platform is here to equip you with the teaching resources and mindset you need to enhance student learning with Strawbees. To help you integrate this project-based approach in your classroom, we provide 3 different approaches for [using Strawbees in your classroom](/how-to-use-strawbees-in-your-classroom).

## Understanding the Strawbees Mindset

Strawbees is not only about making things, but the environment in which they are made. We want to create a learning environment that helps children engage in projects that reflect their ideas and how they see the world. This is readily done through student-centered projects that invite children to explore the variety and versatility of what Strawbees has to offer.

Over the years we have delighted in observing how children play with our materials, creating devices out of Strawbees that can stand, move, spin, glide, or even walk across the floor. Students enjoy the ease and flexibility of these materials, playfully experimenting with what their own hands can create.

With a colorful rainbow of connectors and construction pipes spread across the table, students are sometimes inspired to build small and immensely complex creations; other times, they are inspired to build large lightweight structures that eventually have to migrate to the floor for more space. We have seen children cast spells with magic wands made out of a single construction pipe attached to a 5-leg Strawbees connector, while other children (when challenged with the same build) bent the connector’s leg to make a claw, eventually becoming a back scratcher. A simple tetrahedron can become a hat or the start of a catapult; a small polyhedra can become part of a giant Sierpinski pyramid. The possibilities are endless.

The beauty for teachers is that most Strawbees basic builds require little or no instructions or guidance. Basic builds are all about exploration and experimentation. When children have the opportunity to discover these structures for themselves, it becomes theirs. Even when prompted by questions, kids entirely own their hands-on discoveries. This makes the learning experience more personally engaging, rewarding, and memorable.

This is the kind of learning environment and empowered mindset we want to help you create.

## Our Vision of Success

A successful classroom with Strawbees is a dynamic and collaborative playground with opportunities for students to interact, experiment, and create overlapping projects. Designs can evolve from a stationary catapult into one that walks, or from a mechanical arm into a tetrahedron-inspired creature. In this imaginative space of making and playing, children refine their creative thinking while building projects they care about.

Success is defined by seeing your students fully engage in the Creative Learning Spiral. When students are excited to learn, demonstrate a growing understanding of new knowledge, and improve skills such as collaboration and problem-solving through projects, this is the ultimate achievement. Success is seen in students’ process of learning with Strawbees over a final product.
