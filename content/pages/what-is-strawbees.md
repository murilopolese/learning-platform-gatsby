Strawbees is a construction set, which means it’s made to build things. To say it’s made to build a specific type of things is the same as saying that a certain crayon is only made to draw flowers. The way we think about Strawbees is as a material for people to express, test and share their ideas, developing the necessary skills to think creatively.

The 4 color-coded connectors have respectively 1, 2, 3 and 5 legs. You can fit straws on their legs, slide a straw through the hole or click a leg on a hole. We provide color-coded straws that are carefully measured and resistant enough to endure daily use.

No additional parts are required. You can build structures, mechanical contraptions, and robotic mechanisms all with these 4 connectors. Custom parts can be provided to make it easier to use but you can build a model of anything with those 4 Strawbees connectors.

This is also true for a lot of other construction toys but what puts Strawbees apart is the ability to build the same thing in different scales, navigating through 3 orders of magnitude: You can build small things that measure a few centimetres and fit in your pocket, small objects that can be easily manipulated, larger object that you can wear and gigantic structures that can fit a group of students inside.

Strawbees can also be made out of other materials than plastic, using a die-cut machine with some special knives. Different types of plastic, paper, and other polymers can be cut to make Strawbees and both the Strawbees that comes in the box and the ones you create yourself work together seamlessly.

Our connectors are also excellent to work with cardboard, allowing us to create static and dynamic structures with the same connectors you use with straws.

With just a handful of Strawbees connectors and a few straws or cardboard, there is plenty that can be built, from simple shapes to compound mechanisms. With access to large amounts of Strawbees, which means a box smaller than a TV, there are infinite possibilities.

Whether it’s an idea for an automatic food dispenser for your pet or to understand why it’s impossible to make a regular polygon out of regular hexagons, Strawbees offers a tangible, kinesthetic experience of getting to know complex and sometimes abstract ideas.

We want Strawbees to be a way people can read and make sense of the world by making and remaking the world. A tool to develop ourselves as creative thinkers and invention literates.
