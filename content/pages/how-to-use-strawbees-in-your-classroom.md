At Strawbees we recognize each classroom is unique and that is why we offer a range of equally excellent products and content, balancing personalization and structure without compromising quality.

In the Learning Platform, you will have access to a full range of Activities, Lesson plans, Explorations as well as different ways to navigate through it, highlighting different learning strategies and expected outcomes.

Our learning expectations are tightly coupled with the Sustainable Development Goals and focused mainly on transferable skills, leaving room for you to incorporate the expectations from your local standards.

Some ideas might resonate with you and your organization, some might be the direction you want to move towards or avoid. In any case, we hope Strawbees can be the bridge between you and ideas that seemed impossible before.

# Creative Learning Content

If you are looking for flexible learning opportunities, allows for a wide range of outcomes, low entry-level but high expectations of what can be achieved, you will find the Creative Learning Spiral from MITâ€™s Lifelong Kindergarten as the backbone of our Lesson Plans.

The Lesson Plans are facilitation guides on how to engage in projects and learn along the way, focusing on qualitative measures of learning, student agency and intrinsic motivation.

# Competency-Based Content

If you have a specific set of goals to be achieved and are searching for ways in which your students can have a tangible and kinesthetic experience with it, we recommend you to have a look at Explorations. You will find clear learning expectations followed by a rubric and a template for you to modify it to your taste.

The Explorations are examples of situations you can create with a specific Activity to gain or demonstrate proficiency.

# Stand-Alone Activity

If you already have a plan and is looking for inspiration, examples to show your students or just a prop for your classroom, you can go straight to our Activities and browse a list of step by step instructions each one with tips, tricks, customizations and challenges.
