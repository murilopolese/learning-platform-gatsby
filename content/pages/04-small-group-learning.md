Strawbees has an entire product line available to teachers and educators to use in their learning environments but we also have kits for individual or small groups. The kits we offer to schools are different from the kits you can buy for your home but whatever you can build with one, you can build with the other. So what’s the difference?

# Color coded connectors

![](/connectors.jpg)

Strawbees is a construction set with 4 connectors: 1, 2, 3 and 5 legs. This is true whether your 2 leg connector is white or yellow: What really matters is the amount of legs. There are no special connectors, size and you can do absolutely everything with both, even mix them together. It’s just the color!

All connectors on our individual and small group learning are white because it looks so good! Also because it’s likely that at home you are going to store everything in a box and they are stored all together.

For schools, we gave each connector a color because it’s easier to communicate which connectors you need. But also because they are usually sorted and stored separately and it’s much easier when each one has its own color.

# Pre-cut, color coded pipes

We **hate** when plastic goes to the trash. We really do! Especially when it’s the plastic from our pipes. To reduce the amount of waste generated during play and learning we switched from “cut your own pipes” because even the creations were amazing, it was hard to reuse the material!

We moved away from that and now we offer carefully picked pipe lengths that allows you to build faster, with precision and without waste. We also color coded them for the same reason we did for the connectors.

If you happen to have only one size of pipe, the big ones, fear not! You can [print the PDF](/pipemeasurer.pdf) and cut the exact same sizes as we designed. The cool thing about cutting your own pipes is that you can build very beautiful sculptures with your favorite color!

# Content

All our recent content has been published using the color coded connectors and pre-cut straws because it’s easier to identify the parts. You can browse our [Activities on Strawbees Learning](/activities) to see step by step video instructions, tips and challenges. You can download posters, blueprints of models as well as the video instructions itself.
