# Learning Objectives

* Discuss and explore different community needs, including ways to connect individual neighborhoods into a unified city
* Learn how to implement concepts of sustainability into a city’s development
* Design a city around different scenarios such as geographic location, population growth, conservation, preservation, or prevention against natural disasters
* Reproduce different architectural features in a variety of scales
* Gain a hands-on, kinesthetic understanding of the science and engineering needed to build structures
* Practice communication skills through a collaborative large-scale project

# Preparation

*30 minutes before starting the lesson*

* Print a map of your own city to discuss local surroundings with students
* If you want to offer a landscape challenge for students to build on or around (such as a mountain range or trees), you can make them from cardboard or Strawbees. This might help set the scale of the city if there are space constraints

# Imagine

* “What exactly is a city? How would you describe what a city is?”
* Students can describe the city they are living in or another they have visited
* “What elements make up a city?” For examples:
  * Buses, subways, bicycles
  * People, pets, animals
  * Skyscrapers, apartments, houses, restaurants
  * Museums, places of worship, parks, city hall
  * Police stations, fire stations, schools, stores
* “Do you know when and how this city started?"
* Engage in stories about how the city has changed. Use this conversation to guide students through thinking about how cities are planned, including things like public transportation, water, and roads
* “What types of planning are involved when building a city? Do all cities have the same needs?” For example:
* Housing, architecture, waste management
* Transportation, infrastructure, parks, restaurants
* Water, gas, electricity, phone lines
* Internet, TV channels, radio

# Create

Break students into groups of 3-5 to start building structures for a neighborhood, either imaginary or from the real world. Encourage groups to talk to each other about their plans, and discuss how to solve any city-building problems that come up.

**You can:**

* Challenge students to think about the scale and relevance of the buildings in their neighborhood. Scale can be adjusted by switching straw sizes.
* Challenge all student groups to design their neighborhood around a constraint or condition:
* Geographical environment - a mountain range or a large river delta
* Ecological conservation - a rainforest with endangered animals
* An area prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, fires
* A city experiencing rapid population growth
* Have students create a road system with signage for safety between vehicles and pedestrians, and/or a system to share electricity
* Have students build a vehicle or character to be placed in the city and lead a “tour group” around after the classroom-wide city is created

# Play

**You can:**

* Inspire playfulness and tinkering! Suggest...
  * New ways to commute (such as zip lines or jetpacks)
  * Constructing novel places to play with friends (like a clubhouse or a playground of the future)
* Introduce difficult community situations such as the opening of a big factory nearby, a drastic change in water levels, or some kind of natural or manmade disaster to highlight features of their city design
* Have students design new structures or replace old ones to address whatever difficult community situation you introduce, such as:
* Constructing a large dome to filter pollution
* Building more housing to avoid overcrowding
* Ask students to connect their neighborhoods to form a large city or to expand their neighborhoods so much that everything becomes the city!

# Share

**You can have your students:**

* Make tour groups to visit each neighborhood and present/discuss: :
* Their scenario and whether it was based on the environment, geography, a difficult community situation, etc. and what decisions they made to tailor their city design around that scenario
* The inhabitants of their neighborhood
* Something that their local community celebrates
* Their dream city ideas and what else they would add or change in their neighborhood to realize those dreams
* Make a video tour of their neighborhood and/or city. This could be aerial footage or street-view video from placing a camera or cellphone on a car (or other support) that drives through the city

# Reflect

* “What was the hardest part of building this city for you? What was the most surprising or interesting?”
* “What unexpected challenges came up through this project?”
* “What would you do differently if you could try this again?”
* “Did you experience any conflict in your group? If so, how did you address it?”
* “Who was your neighborhood/city built for? Who are your ideal inhabitants?”
  * Elderly people
  * Parents with infants
  * Giraffes
  * Insects
* “Is your city sustainable? Howso?”
* “How did you modify your neighborhood design based on the scenario?”
