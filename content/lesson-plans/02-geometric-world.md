# Learning Objectives

* Develop spatial reasoning skills; think about objects in two and three dimensions, draw conclusions from limited information
* Recognize geometry in the world and how it can be used
* Create and scale geometric structures; identify and improve weak points
* Learn about the properties of self-similarity and the dimensions of shapes
* Study and identify the fractals and patterns in nature and art

# Preparation

*30 minutes before starting the lesson*

* Create an example of the intended activity
* Gather and prepare support materials

# Imagine

* “What is geometry?
* “How is geometry used in our everyday lives?”
  * Nature - honeycombs, pinecones, trees, snowflakes, ferns
  * Art - creating depth on a flat surface
  * Architecture - the [Giza pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex) or a bridge for structural integrity
  * Robotics - mapping the path of a robot’s hand on an assembly line, 3D printing
  * Chemistry - in the shapes of all atoms and molecules in existence
* “Can geometric shapes be broken down into other shapes?”
* “What happens if you break a geometric shape into smaller or larger versions of itself?” (Self-similarity)
* “What is triangulation?”
* “Is there a shape that can’t be broken into triangles?”

# Create

**Students can:**

* Create a set of shapes and trade with another group and see what each group can build with them.
* Build shapes to make a self-similar structure like a tree full of branches, a snowflake, a cube made out of smaller cubes or the Sierpinski Pyramid. To start, encourage students to draw self-similar shapes and lines on paper.
* Build collaboratively to make large geometric structures (such as an enormous honeycomb, snowflake, etc.)

# Play

**Students can:**

* Invent a new geometric shape. Try to build a complex or even an impossible shape.
* Cut and attach paper panels on the faces of shapes. For example, create a “class clubhouse” by cutting out large sheets of triangles from paper and attaching them to the sides of a Sierpinski pyramid large enough to have different rooms inside of it.
* Experiment with changing the construction pipe size, or changing its angle using a different Strawbees connector, and observe and describe what happens.
* Transform the shapes and lines of your geometric objects into items of your daily life, imagination or to use as a prop on another activity.
* Have students pair up. One student can be the builder and the other can be the reader. The reader will choose a 3-D geometric image out of a hat. The reader must describe the image and how to build it. The builder will try to create the same geometric model based solely on verbal instructions.

# Share

**You can have your students:**

* Engage in a “show-and-tell”, inviting student groups to describe the various shapes and/or artwork they created.
* After building and identifying a variety of geometric shapes, collaboratively connect them into a unique “sculpture” the class can move through.

# Reflect

* “What shapes did you enjoy using most for your building block set? Why?”
* “What did you notice when another student built something with your block set?”
* “What was the most difficult part of creating a set of 3-D building blocks?”
* “Can you make your geometric structures grow infinitely?”
* “Where else have you seen self-similarity in nature?”
