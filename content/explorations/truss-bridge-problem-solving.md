# Understanding the Problem

There are 2 major problems designed for this activity:

* Bridge from original activity or example must be too small to cover the gap distance. We recommend three and half blue straws.
* There is no specific instructions about how to make the load test, except it should not fold of break the straws.

**Emerging**: Identify the designed problems.

**Proficient**: Is able to describe the design challenges and other problems and constraints.

# Possible Approaches

There are many ways in which the bridges can be built differently, here are some groups of possibilities:

* Different sizes by using different straw sizes
* Mixed materials such as cardboard and wooden sticks
* It could have a cantilever or pillars to help the structure

**Emerging**: Identify a few ways to build the bridge.

**Proficient**: Can describe and categorise a wide range of approaches that can be taken.


# Choosing and implementing approach

* A few things that are important to take in consideration:
* The amount of resources provided: A single kit or shared pile?
* Understand if there is time to try out all the possibilities.

**Emerging**: Decide on a design.

**Proficient**: Chose an approach that that fits the constraints  of the problem and execute it with precision.


# Analysis

Students are expected to:

* Compare approaches and iterations during the process of solving the problem
* Rank bridge performance and explain the parameter for judgement

**Emerging**: Identify if bridge behaved as expected.

**Proficient**: Understand and communicate about efficiency of design and based on the answer point out where there should be an improvement or if another design would be a better fit.

# Reflection

Students are expected to:

* Identify a strategy used to solve a problem
* Describe something unexpected or learned
* Reflects if solution was appropriable beyond the designed problems.

**Emerging**: Point out a problem solving situation

**Proficient**: Understand the systematic process of problem solving they went through and point out a situation they might start using problem solving to tackle.
