A classroom set of 10 robotics boards to make it even easier to attach and program servo motors with the micro:bit! You can also control two RGB-pixel lights to create a full light spectum for a show. This board comes with a removeable Strawbees construction clip to snap connectors and straws for making robots or mechanical structures like a crane.

Write in Microsoft MakeCodeâ€™s block-based programming platform, upload a program and remove from the computer to run on batteries.

This is an add-on kit and requires the purchase of another Strawbees product for building robots with construction pipes and connectors.

An individual, smaller version of this Strawbees kit is available
