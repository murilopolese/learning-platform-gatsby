The STEAM School Kit is our most massive construction kit and provides over 4000 pieces. Enough to create enough stacked geometric shapes as tall as a student or work together as a class to create projects large enough to reach the ceiling!

Expand those geometric reasoning skills with five different precut straw sizes for scaling project sizes. This kit arrives as a storage box with pull-out material trays to get started building!

This kit comes with the Pocketful of Ideas card deck with 100+ challenges.

An individual, smaller version of this Strawbees kit is available.
