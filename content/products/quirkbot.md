Transform your Strawbees projects into interactive robots! Using electronic construction pieces, you can program them to life them with Quirkbot. Design linkages and geometric structures make ideal bases for a robot's body or mechanical object.

Connect to the computer, code, and upload a program to tell it to move, blink or both! Make a walker, a blinking star, or a pig shake in fear when it senses darkness.

With the Coding and Robotics kit, you can learn how to program in three different ways: ï¬‚ow, block, and text for all levels of experience. View our programming interface at [code.strawbees.com](https://code.strawbees.com).
