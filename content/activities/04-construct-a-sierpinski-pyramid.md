[Wacław Sierpiński](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wac%C5%82aw_Sierpi%C5%84ski) is the name of a Polish mathematician famous for extensively describing a certain type of self-similar triangle, which means it's not only a triangle made out of other triangles but the drawing pattern repeats independently of the scale. This is true not only in 2 dimensions but also in 3 dimensions, where instead of a Sierpinski triangle you have a **Sierpinski pyramid**.

Building a Sierpinski Pyramid with Strawbees can be done individually but we recommend working as a group to assemble and connect tetrahedrons. You can make a much bigger and interesting construction as a team.
