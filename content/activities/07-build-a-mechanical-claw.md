Each finger of this mechanical claw is a 4 bar linkage where one of the joints is a prismatic joint, which allows the mechanism be handled by pushing and pulling a straw through a connector.

This model has 3 but you can choose any number of fingers you want by using and combining the connectors. You can also extend the claw with an arm made out of a polyhedra of your choice.
