There are many ways to throw things and they all share something in common: You give energy to a projectile in your possession and then release it. This energy can be harvested from your body, a chemical process or a rubber band to name a few. Strawbees have an amazing elastic property that you can use to throw things.

This simple catapult is just a simple example of how you can build something that throws a projectile using just Strawbees but you can easily use other elastic materials that are available around and check which one gives you more energy.
