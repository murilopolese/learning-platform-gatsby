The mechanical crane has at its heart a four-bar linkage. The main mechanical advantage of this specific configuration of the 4 bar linkage is that with a very little hand movement it can generate a much larger movement somewhere else.

Moving the handles separately will allow you to understand what each one does but itâ€™s combining both hands simultaneously that generates the most interesting and challenging movements.
