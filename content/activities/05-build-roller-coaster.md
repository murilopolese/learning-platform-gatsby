This activity could also be called a marble run, rolling ball contraption, Rube Goldberg machine, and many other names. Still, Roller Coaster translates better the idea behind it: create and enjoy a ride!

You can always build a single, monolithic structure for the roller coaster, but this is the hardest way to do it. We recommend creating separate tracks and picking a design that allows fine adjustments because you will need it. A small change in the track's inclination can have a big impact on the speed. You can use a ping pong ball or any spheric object that rolls on the tracks. Paper or [3D printed](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:859499) spheres will work as each one has its weight and surface smoothness challenges.

If you want your track to change direction, you can align them in a way the ball falls gracefully on the other track. Although the falling aspect of it adds some dramatic moments on the ride, usually, it's safer to use a curve track to change direction.

You can add sensors, lifts, and much more with one of our robotic boards like the Quirkbot or BBC micro:bit.
