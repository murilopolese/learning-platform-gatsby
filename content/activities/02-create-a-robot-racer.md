Creating a robot that walks around is a great activity to gain basic building and language skills. By placing the motor on unexpected places, switching the speed it moves as well as upgrading your Strawbees construction and placing carefully the Quirkbot, you can get many styles of movement. We recommend [uploading the Factory Program to your Quirkbot](https://code.strawbees.com/) before the activity.

Organizing the robots on a "race" like situation is a suggestion and can be perfectly replaced by other challenges or constraints.

Once you can observe and describe the different types of motor movements, it's easier to describe how else it should move. Use our [CODE programming interface](https://code.strawbees.com/) to translate it to the Quirkbot.
