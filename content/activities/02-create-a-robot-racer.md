Creating a robot that walks around is a great activity to gain basic building and language skills. By placing the motor in unexpected places, switching the speed it moves, upgrading your Strawbees construction and by considering the placement of the Quirkbot in your build, you can get many styles of movement. We recommend [uploading the Factory Program to your Quirkbot](https://code.strawbees.com/) before the activity.

Organizing the robots in a racing setting is a suggestion and could just as well be replaced by other challenges or constraints.

Once you can observe and describe the different types of motor movements, it's easier to describe how else it should move. Use our [CODE programming interface](https://code.strawbees.com/) to program the Quirkbot.
