Usually with Strawbees, you put together connectors and straws to make something. With the stacking tower, you can explore this idea one level further: Use Strawbees set to create building blocks and then make something with them.

Use different straw sizes and experiment stacking with and without connecting the building blocks. You can start with a simple vertical the tower but also stack horizontally, as a wall or in curved shapes.
