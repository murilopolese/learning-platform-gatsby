When a robot athlete is competing, what do they want to achieve? Below are a list of examples of end-goals in sports:\n\t* Getting the fastest time - 5000-metre run\n\t* Scoring the most points - Basketball\n\t* Grace and skill - Ice skating\n\t* Least amount of swings and penalties - Golf\n\t* Accuracy - Bow and arrow\n\t* Longest distance covered - Long jump\n\t* Well-rounded performance in multiple, short sports - Pentathlon\n* Transform their favorite hobby into a sport such as a circle drawing competition or fishing for the most catches - they don’t need to be limited to what currently exists, they can invent something entirely new!\n* Create a designated area for their sport to take place. This could happen on grass outside, or by taping boundary lines on the carpet or floor inside. Keep the amount of needed space in mind if multiple robots are competing in the same area at the same time. Here are examples of designated sports areas:\n\t* A track for running races\n\t* A pool with individual sections for swimmers\n\t* A 7-metre strip for fencing\n\t* A ski jump ramp\n\t* An ice rink\n\n# Play\n\n**Students can:**\n\n* Modify the existing set of rules by testing different ways of measuring performance or success in the sport. For example, if students create a sport similar to football, they can modify the rules by asking - what if each team had to defend two different goals instead of just one? What if each team could only have 3 players? Encourage students to try different ideas!\n* Transform their robot athlete into a triathlete that can perform well in three different sports.\n* Have their robots compete in other students’ sports!\n* Build a way to keep score or a way to keep track of how long it takes their robot to complete races.\n* Test the impact of friction and gravity on sports by experimenting with different materials. For example, how do robot athletes perform in an “ice skating competition” when the ice is made of printer paper? ...a slippery table top? ...cardboard? ...a tilted surface?\n* Create an area for multiple competitors at once. A team sport is a group of athletes collectively working toward a common goal. Even if one individual can score really well, it’s about teamwork. What is another example of what a team sport could measure?\n\n# Share\n\n**You can have your students:**\n\n* Test their ideas and get feedback from the class for improvement. For a new sport that was just invented, encourage students to document their rules so they can share their sport with others.\n* Put on an opening ceremony where everyone organizes their area first before starting. Before having each student release their robot athletes, have them share with everyone the rules to the sport. Those who are not competing in the games can turn their robots into a cheering audience. You can record and document the opening ceremony and/or sporting events through video or pictures, perhaps having a photo finish for some events.\n* Start a competition for sports with all robots at a starting point with student spectators and non-racing robots, like a flag twirler for example, cheering on the side.\n\n# Reflect\n\n**You can have your students:**\n\n* Create a spot on a table to display everyone’s robots. Students can write down data about their robot’s performance, as well as any observations they made during the building phase. Ask the class:\n\t* “Which of these robot athletes demonstrated:\n\t\t* Grace\n\t\t* Accuracy\n\t\t* Speed\n\t\t* Strength\n\t\t* Endurance?”\n\t* “What was the hardest sport to compete in so far? Why?”\n\t* “If the robot athlete did not perform according to plan, for example if it flipped over, why do you think it did that? What changes could be made to counteract this?”\n\t* “Which sports could these robot athletes perform well in vs. a human?”\n* “If you had another chance to do this, what would you do differently?

The main mechanical advantage of this specific configuration of the 4 bar linkage is that with a very little hand movement it can generate a much larger movement somewhere else.\n\nMoving the handles separately will allow you to understand what each one does but it’s combining both hands simultaneously that generates the most interesting and challenging movements.\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![Add a string and a hook to simulate cables](/crane2.jpg)\n![You can use the connectors holes as guides](/crane3.jpg)\n![Triangulate your structure for additional strength](/crane4.jpg)\n![There are many ways to triangulate structures, try your own first](/crane5.jpg)\n\n</section>\n","path":"/activity/build-a-mechanical-crane","title":"Build a Mechanical Crane","description":"Build an operational mechanical crane and control it with your hands.","thumbnail":"/crane.jpg","header":"/crane.jpg","category":"Activity"},{"content":"\n<section component=\"youtube\" url=\"https://youtu.be/NFeHRBD5Jk8\"></section>\n\nThere are many ways to throw things and they all share something in common: You give energy to a projectile in your possession and then release it. This energy can be harvested from your body, a chemical process or a rubber band to name a few. Strawbees have an amazing elastic property that you can use to throw things.\n\n<section component=\"youtube\" url=\"https://youtu.be/dlDVgL3hAPY\"></section>\n\nThis simple catapult is just a simple example of how you can build something that throws a projectile using just Strawbees but you can easily use other elastic materials that are available around and check which one gives you more energy.\n\n<section component=\"youtube\" url=\"https://youtu.be/Im4P45_L6Zg\"></section>\n","path":"/activity/build-a-catapult","title":"Build a Catapult","description":"Launch a projectile across the room with a Strawbees catapult.","thumbnail":"/catapult.jpg","header":"/catapult.jpg","category":"Activity"},{"content":"\n# Understanding the Problem\n\nThere are 2 major problems designed for this activity:\n\n* Bridge from original activity or example must be too small to cover the gap distance. We recommend three and half blue straws.\n* There is no specific instructions about how to make the load test, except it should not fold of break the straws.\n\n**Emerging**: Identify the designed problems.\n\n**Proficient**: Is able to describe the design challenges and other problems and constraints.\n\n# Possible Approaches\n\nThere are many ways in which the bridges can be built differently, here are some groups of possibilities:\n\n* Different sizes by using different straw sizes\n* Mixed materials such as cardboard and wooden sticks\n* It could have a cantilever or pillars to help the structure\n\n**Emerging**: Identify a few ways to build the bridge.\n\n**Proficient**: Can describe and categorise a wide range of approaches that can be taken.\n\n\n# Choosing and implementing approach\n\n* A few things that are important to take in consideration:\n* The amount of resources provided: A single kit or shared pile?\n* Understand if there is time to try out all the possibilities.\n\n**Emerging**: Decide on a design.\n\n**Proficient**: Chose an approach that that fits the constraints  of the problem and execute it with precision.\n\n\n# Analysis\n\nStudents are expected to:\n\n* Compare approaches and iterations during the process of solving the problem\n* Rank bridge performance and explain the parameter for judgement\n\n**Emerging**: Identify if bridge behaved as expected.\n\n**Proficient**: Understand and communicate about efficiency of design and based on the answer point out where there should be an improvement or if another design would be a better fit.\n\n# Reflection\n\nStudents are expected to:\n\n* Identify a strategy used to solve a problem\n* Describe something unexpected or learned\n* Reflects if solution was appropriable beyond the designed problems.\n\n**Emerging**: Point out a problem solving situation\n\n**Proficient**: Understand the systematic process of problem solving they went through and point out a situation they might start using problem solving to tackle.\n","path":"/exploration/truss-bridge-problem-solving","title":"Truss Bridge: Problem Solving","description":"Gain and demonstrate proficiency in problem solving with this bridge exploration.","thumbnail":"/trussproblemsolving.jpg","header":"/trussproblemsolving.jpg","category":"Exploration"}]}}}
