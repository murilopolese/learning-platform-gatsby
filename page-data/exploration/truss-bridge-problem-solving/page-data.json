We recommend three and half blue straws.\n* There is no specific instructions about how to make the load test, except it should not fold of break the straws.\n\n**Emerging**: Identify the designed problems.\n\n**Proficient**: Is able to describe the design challenges and other problems and constraints.\n\n# Possible Approaches\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![](/truss.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving21.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving01.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving18.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving20.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving22.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving23.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving24.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving30.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving40.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving42.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\nThere are many ways in which the bridges can be built differently, here are some groups of possibilities:\n\n* Different sizes by using different straw sizes\n* Mixed materials such as cardboard and wooden sticks\n* It could have a cantilever or pillars to help the structure\n\n**Emerging**: Identify a few ways to build the bridge.\n\n**Proficient**: Can describe and categorise a wide range of approaches that can be taken.\n\n\n# Choosing and implementing approach\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![](/trussproblemsolving43.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving44.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\nA few things that are important to take in consideration:\n\n* The amount of resources provided: A single kit or shared pile?\n* Understand if there is time to try out all the possibilities.\n\n**Emerging**: Decide on a design.\n\n**Proficient**: Chose an approach that that fits the constraints  of the problem and execute it with precision.\n\n\n# Analysis\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![](/trussproblemsolving03.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving04.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving05.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving11.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving12.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving07.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving08.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving13.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving10.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving14.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving15.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving16.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving26.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\nStudents are expected to:\n\n* Compare approaches and iterations during the process of solving the problem\n* Rank bridge performance and explain the parameter for judgement\n\n**Emerging**: Identify if bridge behaved as expected.\n\n**Proficient**: Understand and communicate about efficiency of design and based on the answer point out where there should be an improvement or if another design would be a better fit.\n\n# Reflection\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![](/trussproblemsolving30.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving31.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving32.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving33.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving37.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving38.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving39.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving42.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving40.jpg)\n![](/trussproblemsolving41.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\nStudents are expected to:\n\n* Identify a strategy used to solve a problem\n* Describe something unexpected or learned\n* Reflects if solution was appropriable beyond the designed problems.\n\n**Emerging**: Point out a problem solving situation\n\n**Proficient**: Understand the systematic process of problem solving they went through and point out a situation they might start using problem solving to tackle.\n","path":"/exploration/truss-bridge-problem-solving","title":"Truss Bridge: Problem Solving","description":"Gain and demonstrate proficiency in problem solving with this bridge exploration.","thumbnail":"/trussproblemsolving.jpg","header":"/trussproblemsolving.jpg","category":"Exploration"}}}}
