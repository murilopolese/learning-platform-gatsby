By placing the motor on unexpected places, switching the speed it moves as well as upgrading your Strawbees construction and placing carefully the Quirkbot, you can get many styles of movement. We recommend [uploading the Factory Program to your Quirkbot](https://code.strawbees.com/) before the activity.\n\nOrganising the robots on a \"race\" like situation is a suggestion and can be perfectly replaced by other challenge or constraint.\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![Running in a straight line can be challenging](/robotracer3.jpg)\n![Add obstacles and modify the shape of robot bodies to create new situations](/robotracer2.jpg)\n![Changing the surface material and angle can cause dramatic changes on your robot's performance](/robotracer4.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\nOnce you are able to observe and describe the different types of motor movements, it's easier to describe how else it should move. Use our [CODE programming interface](https://code.strawbees.com/) to translate it to the Quirkbot.\n\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![Quirkbot works on Google Chrome Browser and ChromeOS](/robotracer5.jpg)\n![Uploading an empty program to your Quirkbot if you want to start from scratch](/robotracer6.jpg)\n![Use Flow programming to change how your robot moves](/robotracer7.jpg)\n\n</section>\n","path":"/activity/create-a-robot-racer","title":"Create a Robot Racer","description":"Build a robot that walks and then try to make it run.","thumbnail":"/robotracer.jpg","header":"/robotracer.jpg","category":"Activity"}}}}
