This is true not only in 2 dimensions but also in 3 dimensions, where instead of a Sierpinski triangle you have a **Sierpinski pyramid**.\n\n![A Sierpinski Pyramid is made entirely of self similar arrangements of tetrahedrons](/sierpinki2.jpg)\n\nBuilding a Sierpinski Pyramid with Strawbees can be done individually but we recommend working as a group to assemble and connect tetrahedrons. You can make a much bigger and interesting construction as a team.\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![Building the pyramid alone can be tedious, working in groups is more engaging and effective](/sierpinki3.jpg)\n![The structure scales and it can get big enough to easily fit students inside](/sierpinki7.jpg)\n![Examining this structure from many perspectives reveals different things about it](/sierpinki5.jpg)\n![Explore the joy of building together and achieving a goal through collaboration](/sierpinki6.jpg)\n![Building large Strawbees structures is fun, safe and silent on the fall.](/sierpinki4.jpg)\n\n</section>\n","path":"/activity/construct-a-sierpinki-pyramid","title":"Construct a Sierpinski Pyramid","description":"Construct a modular, fractal structure with tetrahedral shapes.","thumbnail":"/sierpinski.jpg","header":"/sierpinski.jpg","category":"Activity"}}}}
