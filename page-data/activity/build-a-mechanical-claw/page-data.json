You can also extend the claw with an arm made out of a polyhedron of your choice.\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![Make it in many sizes!](/claw2.jpg)\n![Extend the claw with an arm so it's easier to handle](/claw3.jpg)\n![Open and close the arm by pulling and pushing a single straw](/claw4.jpg)\n\n</section>\n","path":"/activity/build-a-mechanical-claw","title":"Build a Mechanical Claw","description":"Make a 3 finger claw to grab objects from any direction moving a single straw.","thumbnail":"/claw.jpg","header":"/claw.jpg","category":"Activity"}}}}
