From all possible convex polyhedra only five can be made with regular polygons as faces. There are many ways to prove there can't be a sixth Platonic solid, one of them is trying it yourself!\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![Tetrahedron](/platonic2.jpg)\n![Hexahedron](/platonic3.jpg)\n![Octaherdon](/platonic12.jpg)\n![Dodecahedron](/platonic4.jpg)\n![Icosaherdon](/platonic5.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\nPlatonic Solids can be combined in many different ways. They are commonly connected by the corners (vertex), edges or just stacked. Be creative and avoid solutions that fold or damage the straws, they are reusable.\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![Combine the platonic solids in different shapes and sizes](/platonic6.jpg)\n![Stacking them reveals interesting geometric properties](/platonic7.jpg)\n![Connect them face by face with other solids](/platonic8.jpg)\n![If you slide a straw through two connectors you can have mechanical properties](/platonic9.jpg)\n![Strawbees developed a connector that helps young children to connect shapes](/platonic10.jpg)\n![Explore the resources around you to extend and improve your build](/platonic11.jpg)\n\n</section>\n","path":"/activity/build-the-platonic-solids","title":"Build the Platonic Solids","description":"Build the shapes that have intrigued philosophers, mathematicians and scientists for centuries.","thumbnail":"/platonic.jpg","header":"/platonic.jpg","category":"Activity"}}}}
