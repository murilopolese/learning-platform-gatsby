With the stacking tower you can explore this idea one level further: Use Strawbees set to create building blocks and then make something with them.\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![Fit the connectors legs all the way through to tighten up](/tower2.jpg)\n![Experiment with different straw sizes and try stacking them](/tower3.jpg)\n![Stacking also works for other shapes than cubes](/tower4.jpg)\n\n</section>\n\nUse different straw sizes and experiment stacking with and without connecting the building blocks together. You can start with a simple vertical the tower but also stack horizontally, as a wall or in curved shapes.\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![Go beyond a tower and explore other architectural features](/tower6.jpg)\n![Dream big, build bigger!](/tower7.jpg)\n\n</section>\n","path":"/activity/build-a-stacking-tower","title":"Build a Stacking Tower","description":"Build big by stacking Strawbees cubes and add custom shapes to style it","thumbnail":"/tower.jpg","header":"/tower.jpg","category":"Activity"}}}}
