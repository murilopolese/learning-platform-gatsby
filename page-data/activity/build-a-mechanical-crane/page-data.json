The main mechanical advantage of this specific configuration of the 4 bar linkage is that with a very little hand movement it can generate a much larger movement somewhere else.\n\nMoving the handles separately will allow you to understand what each one does but itâ€™s combining both hands simultaneously that generates the most interesting and challenging movements.\n\n<section component=\"gallery\">\n\n![Add a string and a hook to simulate cables](/crane2.jpg)\n![You can use the connector holes as guides](/crane3.jpg)\n![Triangulate your structure for additional strength](/crane4.jpg)\n![There are many ways to triangulate structures, try your own first](/crane5.jpg)\n\n</section>\n","path":"/activity/build-a-mechanical-crane","title":"Build a Mechanical Crane","description":"Build an operational mechanical crane and control it with your hands.","thumbnail":"/crane.jpg","header":"/crane.jpg","category":"Activity"}}}}
