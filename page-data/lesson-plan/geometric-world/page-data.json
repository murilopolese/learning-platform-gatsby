To start, encourage students to draw self-similar shapes and lines on paper.\n* Build collaboratively to make large geometric structures (such as an enormous honeycomb, snowflake, etc.)\n\n<section component=\"thumbnails\">\n<section component=\"thumbnail\" title=\"Build the Platonic Solids\" description=\"Build the shapes that have intrigued philosophers, mathematicians and scientists for centuries.\" image=\"/platonic.jpg\" path=\"/activity/build-the-platonic-solids\"></section>\n<section component=\"thumbnail\" title=\"Construct the Sierpinski Pyramid\" description=\"Construct a modular, fractal structure with tetrahedral shapes.\" image=\"/sierpinski.jpg\" path=\"/activity/construct-a-sierpinski-pyramid\"></section>\n</section>\n\n# Play\n\n**Students can:**\n\n* Invent a new geometric shape. Try to build a complex or even an impossible shape.\n* Cut and attach paper panels on the faces of shapes. For example, create a “class clubhouse” by cutting out large sheets of triangles from paper and attaching them to the sides of a Sierpinski pyramid large enough to have different rooms inside of it.\n* Experiment with changing the construction pipe size, or changing its angle using a different Strawbees connector, and observe and describe what happens.\n* Transform the shapes and lines of your geometric objects into items of your daily life, imagination or to use as a prop on another activity.\n* Have students pair up. One student can be the builder and the other can be the reader. The reader will choose a 3-D geometric image out of a hat. The reader must describe the image and how to build it. The builder will try to create the same geometric model based solely on verbal instructions.\n\n# Share\n\n**You can have your students:**\n\n* Engage in a “show-and-tell”, inviting student groups to describe the various shapes and/or artwork they created.\n* After building and identifying a variety of geometric shapes, collaboratively connect them into a unique “sculpture” the class can move through.\n\n# Reflect\n\n* “What shapes did you enjoy using most for your building block set? Why?”\n* “What did you notice when another student built something with your block set?”\n* “What was the most difficult part of creating a set of 3-D building blocks?”\n* “Can you make your geometric structures grow infinitely?”\n* “Where else have you seen self-similarity in nature?”\n","path":"/lesson-plan/geometric-world","title":"Geometric World","description":"Develop spatial reasoning by creating and identifying geometric shapes.","thumbnail":"/geometricworld.jpg","header":"/geometricworld.jpg","category":"Lesson Plan"}}}}
