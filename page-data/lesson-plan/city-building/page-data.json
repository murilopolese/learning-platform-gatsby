This might help set the scale of the city if there are space constraints\n\n# Imagine\n\n* “What exactly is a city? How would you describe what a city is?”\n* Students can describe the city they are living in or another they have visited\n* “What elements make up a city?” For examples:\n  * Buses, subways, bicycles\n  * People, pets, animals\n  * Skyscrapers, apartments, houses, restaurants\n  * Museums, places of worship, parks, city hall\n  * Police stations, fire stations, schools, stores\n* “Do you know when and how this city started?\"\n* Engage in stories about how the city has changed. Use this conversation to guide students through thinking about how cities are planned, including things like public transportation, water, and roads\n* “What types of planning are involved when building a city? Do all cities have the same needs?” For example:\n* Housing, architecture, waste management\n* Transportation, infrastructure, parks, restaurants\n* Water, gas, electricity, phone lines\n* Internet, TV channels, radio\n\n# Create\n\nBreak students into groups of 3-5 to start building structures for a neighborhood, either imaginary or from the real world. Encourage groups to talk to each other about their plans, and discuss how to solve any city-building problems that come up.\n\n<section component=\"thumbnails\">\n<section component=\"thumbnail\" title=\"Build a Stacking Tower\" description=\"Build big by stacking Strawbees cubes and add custom shapes to style it.\" image=\"/tower.jpg\" path=\"/activity/build-a-stacking-tower\"></section>\n<section component=\"thumbnail\" title=\"Build a Truss Bridge\" description=\"Build a truss bridge and use your hands to understand structural integrity.\" image=\"/truss.jpg\" path=\"/activity/build-a-truss-bridge\"></section>\n</section>\n\n**You can:**\n\n* Challenge students to think about the scale and relevance of the buildings in their neighborhood. Scale can be adjusted by switching straw sizes.\n* Challenge all student groups to design their neighborhood around a constraint or condition:\n* Geographical environment - a mountain range or a large river delta\n* Ecological conservation - a rainforest with endangered animals\n* An area prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, fires\n* A city experiencing rapid population growth\n* Have students create a road system with signage for safety between vehicles and pedestrians, and/or a system to share electricity\n* Have students build a vehicle or character to be placed in the city and lead a “tour group” around after the classroom-wide city is created\n\n# Play\n\n**You can:**\n\n* Inspire playfulness and tinkering! Suggest...\n  * New ways to commute (such as zip lines or jetpacks)\n  * Constructing novel places to play with friends (like a clubhouse or a playground of the future)\n* Introduce difficult community situations such as the opening of a big factory nearby, a drastic change in water levels, or some kind of natural or manmade disaster to highlight features of their city design\n* Have students design new structures or replace old ones to address whatever difficult community situation you introduce, such as:\n* Constructing a large dome to filter pollution\n* Building more housing to avoid overcrowding\n* Ask students to connect their neighborhoods to form a large city or to expand their neighborhoods so much that everything becomes the city!\n\n# Share\n\n**You can have your students:**\n\n* Make tour groups to visit each neighborhood and present/discuss: :\n* Their scenario and whether it was based on the environment, geography, a difficult community situation, etc. and what decisions they made to tailor their city design around that scenario\n* The inhabitants of their neighborhood\n* Something that their local community celebrates\n* Their dream city ideas and what else they would add or change in their neighborhood to realize those dreams\n* Make a video tour of their neighborhood and/or city. This could be aerial footage or street-view video from placing a camera or cellphone on a car (or other support) that drives through the city\n\n# Reflect\n\n* “What was the hardest part of building this city for you? What was the most surprising or interesting?”\n* “What unexpected challenges came up through this project?”\n* “What would you do differently if you could try this again?”\n* “Did you experience any conflict in your group? If so, how did you address it?”\n* “Who was your neighborhood/city built for? Who are your ideal inhabitants?”\n  * Elderly people\n  * Parents with infants\n  * Giraffes\n  * Insects\n* “Is your city sustainable? Howso?”\n* “How did you modify your neighborhood design based on the scenario?”\n","path":"/lesson-plan/city-building","title":"City Building","description":"Discuss and explore different community needs, including ways to connect individual neighborhoods into a unified city.","thumbnail":"/citybuilding.jpg","header":"/citybuilding.jpg","category":"Lesson Plan"}}}}
