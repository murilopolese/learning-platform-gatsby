This might help set the scale of the city if there are space constraints\n\n# Imagine\n\n- “What exactly is a city? How would you describe what a city is?”\n- Students can describe the city they are living in or another they have visited\n- “What elements make up a city?” For examples:\n\t- Buses, subways, bicycles\n\t- People, pets, animals\n\t- Skyscrapers, apartments, houses, restaurants\n\t- Museums, places of worship, parks, city hall\n\t- Police stations, fire stations, schools, stores\n- “Do you know when and how this city, ______, started?”\n- Engage in stories about how the city has changed. Use this conversation to guide students through thinking about how cities are planned, including things like public transportation, water, and roads\n- “What types of planning are involved when building a city? Do all cities have the same needs?” For example:\n- Housing, architecture, waste management\n- Transportation, infrastructure, parks, restaurants\n- Water, gas, electricity, phone lines\n- Internet, TV channels, radio\n\n# Create\n\nBreak students into groups of 3-5 to start building structures for a neighborhood, either imaginary or from the real world. Encourage groups to talk to each other about their plans, and discuss how to solve any city-building problems that come up.\n\n<section component=\"thumbnail\" title=\"Build a Stacking Tower\" description=\"Build big by stacking Strawbees cubes and add custom shapes to style it\" thumbnail=\"/tower.jpg\" path=\"/activities/build-a-stacking-tower\" />\n<section component=\"thumbnail\" title=\"Build a Truss Bridge\" description=\"Build a truss bridge and use your hands to understand structural integrity.\" thumbnail=\"/truss.jpg\" path=\"/activities/build-a-truss-bridge\" />\n","path":"/lesson-plan/make-a-mechanical-arm","title":"City Building","description":"Discuss and explore different community needs, including ways to connect individual neighborhoods into a unified city.","thumbnail":"/citybuilding.jpg","header":"/citybuilding.jpg","category":"Lesson Plan"}}}}
